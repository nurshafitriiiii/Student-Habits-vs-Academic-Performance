 README: Student Habits vs Academic Performance (Machine Learning Project)

1. Project Overview
This project explores how various lifestyle factors influence student academic performance using machine learning. The dataset includes information on students' diet quality, internet access, parental education, part-time job status, extracurricular participation, and more — with the target variable being their **exam score**.

2. Objective
To build predictive models that estimate students' exam performance based on their personal habits and demographic characteristics.

 Files Included
| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `student_habits_performance.csv` | Source dataset (required for the code to run) |
| `student_habits_analysis.py` | Main Python script containing the full data analysis and machine learning pipeline |
| `plots/` | Folder containing all visualization output (.png files) |
| `README.md` | This file — explains the purpose, structure, and usage of the project |

Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualizations
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning

 Features & Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Loads CSV file
   - Fills missing values in `parental_education_level`

2. **Visualization**
   - Categorical feature distributions
   - Numerical distributions
   - Correlation heatmap

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Manual label encoding for ordinal features (`diet_quality`, `internet_quality`, `parental_education_level`)
   - One-hot encoding for nominal categorical features (`gender`, `part_time_job`, `extracurricular_participation`)

4. **Data Scaling**
   - StandardScaler used to normalize numeric features

5. **Modeling**
   - Splits data (80% training, 20% test)
   - Trains 5 models:
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge Regression
     - Lasso Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Uses R² Score and RMSE for comparison
   - Output printed directly to console

 Outputs
- **Performance metrics** for each model printed in the terminal:
  ```
  Linear Regression → R²: 0.XX, RMSE: XX.XX
  Ridge → R²: 0.XX, RMSE: XX.XX
  ...
  ```
- **Saved Plots** (in `/plots` folder):
  - `categorical_distributions.png`
  - `numerical_distributions.png`
  - `correlation_heatmap.png`

 How to Run

1. Place `student_habits_performance.csv` in the same directory as the `.py` file.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python student_habits_analysis.py
   ```
3. Check the `plots/` folder for saved charts.
4. Read the terminal output for model comparisons.

 Notes
- The code supports UTF-8 characters.
- Script is modular and well-commented for ease of understanding.
- Visualization files can be used in your final report or presentation.
